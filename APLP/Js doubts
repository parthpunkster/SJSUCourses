1) What is var, is it an int or its a variable type..like in c or java we do int i = ??

2) var addList = function (list){.....in this what is function keyword..also how is this similar to haskell and how can we declare the function by assigning it to a variable also if considered the haskell way is addList a function or a variable.

3) var addList = function(list) {
if (list.length === 0) {
return 0;
}
return list[0]
+ addList(list.slice(1));...How does this portion work, what does .slice do..is .slice a method if yes what all arguments it can take?
}

4)Since i am not familiar with oop that much so can u tell me what exactly is this.? and a few basic concept of object ,,like what is an object and what and where it is used.
